                        <p>To inspire breakthroughs the way the Democratic Republic of Congo <br />
         treats children and to achieve immediate and lasting change in their lives.</p>
                        <p>To make Children Believe creates a future of hope for themselves,<br />
                            for their families, and communities by helping them to develop <br />
                            the skills and resources to overcome poverty and injustice.
          </p>
                        <p>We are also working to eliminate hunger and improve the health<br />
                         and well-being of our community through access to healthy<br />
                         and nutritious foods, community education and advocacy

                        <p>CYCO-Youth and Child Protection works exclusively to improve the resilience and<br />
                        wellbeing of children living with violence and armed conflict.<br />
                         We empower children in everything we do. We work to unleash <br />
                         their inner strength through our creative and engaging approach.<br />

                        <h5>VISION</h5>
                        <p>Our vision is to make sure every child attains the right<br />
                         to survival, protection, development and participation.</p>
                        <p>We envision a community where everyone has access to good quality,<br />
                          nutritious food, understands the consequences of hunger and poor nutrition
                         </p>
                        <p>We also aim to work to an environment which no child’s life<br />
                          is torn apart by war since armed conflict is a reality for millions <br />
                          of children today in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
                         </p>
                        <p>We’re committed to supporting these children to overcome their experiences,<br />
                          and have a real chance at a better future. Children and young people have<br />
                           the right to grow up free fear and violence, to develop to their full<br />
                            potential and contribute to a peaceful future for themselves and for their communities.

                    <h5>STRATEGY</h5>
                    <p>CYCO-Youth and Child Protection was founded on the belief <br />
                    that every child has the potential to change his own life and that of the world at large.<br />
                     This belief remains at the heart of the organization today. <br />
                     It underpins everything we say and do - as reflected in our strategy <strong>‘What we believe, what we’ll do’.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>We’ll work with children to create an environment where they don’t just survive, but thrive.<br />
                     So they can realize their full potential and go on to change the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>The threats faced by millions of children – poverty, conflict, hunger – are daunting.<br />
                     But in a world of unprecedented wealth and potential, we have both a remarkable opportunity<br />
                      and a responsibility to transform children’s chances – and the future we all share.

                    </p>
                    <p>Together we can ensure that every child survives, learns and is protected.<br />
                     So that they can have the chance to fulfill their potential and to go on to build a better world.<br />
                        <strong>Our strategy</strong>  shows how, together, we can help make that promise a reality.
